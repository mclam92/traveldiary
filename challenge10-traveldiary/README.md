This webpage was created for the final challenge in my IMT 549 Beginning Web Development Course in Spring 2019 for the University of Washington. As the project ask to apply all the various skills from the entire course, I created a webpage to track some of my adventures abroad. As I have always wanted a digital travel diary to document my journeys, I thought this would be a great space to finally do so.
